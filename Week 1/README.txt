Candidate Elimination Algorithm App:

This is a Streamlit web application that implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm. 
The Candidate Elimination algorithm is a machine learning algorithm used for concept learning in the presence of noise or errors in data. 
It tries to find the most specific hypothesis that fits all positive training examples and the most general hypothesis that fits all negative training examples.

Usage:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Streamlit app using the command streamlit run app.py.
Upload a CSV file containing your dataset.
View the final specific and general hypotheses generated by the Candidate Elimination algorithm.

File Structure:

app.py: Contains the main Streamlit application code.
requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies required to run the application.
README.md: Documentation providing information about the application and instructions for usage.

About the Candidate Elimination Algorithm:

The Candidate Elimination algorithm is a concept learning algorithm used for machine learning tasks. 
It iteratively refines the hypotheses space by eliminating hypotheses that are inconsistent with the training data. 
It maintains two sets of hypotheses: the specific hypotheses (specific_h) and the general hypotheses (general_h). 
The specific hypotheses represent the most specific concept consistent with the training data, while the general hypotheses represent the most general concept consistent with the training data.
